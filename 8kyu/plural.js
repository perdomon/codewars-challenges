// Plural
// Take a number and return 'yes' if a plural should be used, 'no' if not

function plural(n) {
  return(n !== 1)
  }

// Pay attention to the phrasing of questions. This problem is easiest solved when trying to accomplish the singular side 
// of the question vs. focusing on plurals and zero.
